<h2> What does Console do?</h2>
<p>
A console "Enables us to interact with a web page by executing JavaScript expressions in the contents of the page." It is used to store outputs of the code. Click "Inspect" on the word "Console" I have put at the top of the screen, and then go to console and view some things I have put there.
